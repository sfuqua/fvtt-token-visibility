# Custom Foundry types

This folder contains hand-made typings for Foundry based on a combination of [Foundry VTT API docs](https://foundryvtt.com/api/) and inspection/debugging of `foundry.js` while Foundry is running.

In general, I've only mapped out the minimum surface of a type that I need to get the module working as intended.
